# HelloHoloWorld

Let's learn the basics of HoloLens?
The good news is that you don't need one. There is an awesome emulator that we can use it!

## What we need?

- Unity 2017.2.3f1 
- MRTK [Mixed Reality Toolkit](https://github.com/Microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity) from Microsft
- Visual Studio 2017
- Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise or Education (doesn't work with Home)
- [HoloLens emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using-the-hololens-emulator) (optional)
